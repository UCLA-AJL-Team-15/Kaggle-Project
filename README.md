## Project Brief + Connection to BTTAI
This Kaggle competition is a great chance for students in BTTAI to be able to apply their skills to a real-world problem in a flexible, safe learning space. By participating in this challenge, we as students will gain valuable experience in model development, data analysis, and ethical AI considerations, as well as be able to learn more about different skin conditions and the markers that can identify them.


## Project Objective
Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify dermatological conditions from images as accurately as possible. The dataset is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, containing around 4,500 labeled images representing 21 different skin conditions. We will develop a classification model that will maximize the weighted average F1 score, making sure that both precision and recall are optimized across different classes.


## Real World Significance
It goes without saying that accurate classification of dermatological conditions is critical for early diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases, including serious conditions such as melanoma. Existing AI models can struggle with classification due to biases and generalizations, especially when shown images that span a lot of different skin tones. By working on this competition, we can contribute to the development of more inclusive and fair medical AI systems. We hope that insights we uncover and conclusions we draw in this challenge can help improve diagnostic tools, assist medtech specialists and dermatologists, and expand access to healthcare.
